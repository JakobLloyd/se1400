        <h4>Portfolio and Workplace Competition</h4>
        <p>Other competitors websites or portfolios are usually based on another website such as Wix. Others have physical portfolios showcasing all their work they have done in the drafting field. Some strengths that other drafters or people in the profession have are lots of experience to showcase the work they did in the field. One thing I can do is create a custom website that has all my information on it instead of using a third party website, also I can say I built it. </p>
