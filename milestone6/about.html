            <h1>ABOUT AND INFORMATION</h1>
          </div>
          <p>Hello! I’m Jakob Lloyd, a CAD drafting professional transitioning
             into software engineering, currently pursuing my Bachelors at
              Utah Tech University in St. George, UT. My career began in 
              the architectural trenches—drafting precise renovation plans
               for schools, banks, and fire stations—but my curiosity
                for technology has led me to a new challenge: building
                 systems with code.
          </p>
          <div class="left-paragraph">
            <h2>From Drafting Tables to Development Environments</h2>
            <p> My hands-on experience at AC+Co Architecture in Salem, OR, involved creating detailed AutoCAD construction documents for complex remodeling projects. Unlike new construction, renovations demand a keen eye—I’d analyze existing structures, and draft demolition/renovation plans For example:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>BankBank Remodeling: Remodeled a few banks throughout the state of Oregon that needed upgrades to their infrastructure.</li>
              <li>Gymnasium Expansion: Drafted phased construction plans to expand during the academic year.</li>
              <li>ADA Upgrades: Reworked layouts to meet accessibility standards without compromising emergency vehicle access and wheelchair ramps.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="left-paragraph">
              <h2>Why Software Engineering?</h2>
            </div>
            </p>
            <p>Architecture and coding share a core principle: solving real-world problems through structured logic. My drafting work required meticulous attention to detail—every line in AutoCAD had to align with contractor specs… redlines included, just as every semicolon in code must be precise. Now, as I study Python, HTML/CSS, and Linux, I’m effectively learning how software works.
              What drives me? The intersection of logic and creativity. Just as I once collaborated with architects to resolve design challenges, I now am fixated with dissecting tech problems—whether working on Linux server configurations, debugging Python scripts, or designing a website. This portfolio reflects my dual expertise: explore my CAD/Revit projects for architectural precision or my software engineering work to see how I’m coding my next chapter.

            <h2>Academic Journey</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Certifications: Earned credentials in Architectural Drafting and AutoCAD (Chemeketa Community College).</li>
              <li>Graduated with an associate degree from Chemeketa</li>
              <li>Current Focus: Expanding into object-oriented programming, databases, and web development at Utah Tech.</li>
              <li>Side Projects: Brushing up on my Revit and AutoCAD skills, building a game, and this website.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Let’s Connect! I split time between Bountiful, UT, and Dallas, OR, and am open to internships or freelance work in either region. Explore my CAD projects, coding experiments, or reach out via the Contact page.
