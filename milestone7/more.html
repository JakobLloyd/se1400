            <h1>MEET ME PERSONALLY</h1>
          </div>
          <p>I thrive on challenge and discovery—whether
             pushing my limits in the gym, analyzing game mechanics,
              or exploring new places. Fitness keeps me disciplined,
               gaming sharpens my strategic thinking, and adventures
                fuel my curiosity. The people around me are very important
                 in my life and some of my favorite activities with them
                 are game nights, spending time with family, or even weight
                  training with them. Currently I’m balancing
                   weightlifting goals, student life, and family as
                    well as friends. I’m Always up for new experiences!

            <h2>People & Connections</h2>
            <p>At the end of the day, what matters most are the people
               around me. Whether it’s game nights with friends, helping
                my family with tech issues (my unofficial IT role), or
                 just sharing a meal, these moments keep me grounded. My
                  collaborative work in architecture and my growing
                   network in tech all stem from the same belief: great
                    things happen when you combine skills with genuine
                     relationships.</p>
            <h2>Fitness & Discipline</h2>
            <p>Lifting or rather working out is one of my main hobbies if you can call it one.
               Just like in coding or drafting, progress comes from
                consistency—showing up, putting in the reps, and iterating
                 over time. Lifting weights taught me the value of incremental
                  improvement, a mindset I apply to learning new programming
                   languages or refining my CAD skills. Plus, it’s the perfect
                    counterbalance to long hours in school!</p>
            <h2>Gaming & Problem-Solving</h2>
            <p>When I'm not coding or drafting, you'll often find me gaming—whether it's competitive
               games, open-world RPGs, or strategy games. More than just entertainment, gaming has
                sharpened my ability to think critically, adapt to new challenges, and work under
                 pressure. I love analyzing game mechanics, which has actually helped me approach
                  software development with a user-first mindset. (Fun fact: I’ve modded several
                   games before for fun.)</p>
            <h2>Exploration and New Experiences</h2>

            </div>
            <div class="content-text">
              <p>Personally, I have a strong curiosity for exploration, whether
                 it's hiking through Oregon's forests, road-tripping to new
                  cities, or just discovering hidden local spots. Adventure keeps
                   me inspired—there's always something new to learn from different
                    places and people. This love for exploration translates directly
                     to my work; I approach coding and design with the same
                      willingness to venture into unfamiliar territory and figure
                       things out along the way.</p>
